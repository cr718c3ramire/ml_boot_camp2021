    "\n",
    "Starting with an empty model you build $m$ simple linear regression models and then choose the one with lowest testing error (for instance by looking at the average cv error). Call this model $1$. \n",

    "Take model $1$ and go through the remaining $m-1$ features and add them one at a time to model $1$. This will give you $m-1$ two feature models. Look at the one with lowest testing error, call it model $2$. If model $2$ has lower testing error than model $1$ continue in this way and look at the remaining $m-2$ predictors. If model $1$ has the lower testing error you stop and model $1$ is the model you choose.\n",
    "\n",
    "You continue until you either find a model with lowest testing error (for example if model $3$ had lower testing error than model $4$ you chose model $3$), or until you have built the model regressing $y$ on all of $X_1,\\dots,X_m$.\n",

    "Starting with the model regressing $y$ on all of $X_1,\\dots,X_m$, remove each of the $X_i$ predictors one at a time, regressing $y$ on the remaining $m-1$ features. If one of these models has lower testing error than the full model take it and call it model $1$. If none of those models has lower testing error than the full model stick with the full model.\n",

    "Take model $1$ and remove each of the $m-1$ predictors one at a time, regressing $y$ on the remaining $m-2$ features.

    "\n",
    "###### Greedy Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "These are both <i>greedy algorithms</i> because at each step you take the move that benefits you the most in the moment, but you don't explore suboptimal paths that may be better in the long run. While you may not get the best model, you're willing to go with a model that is close to correct in a faster time.
