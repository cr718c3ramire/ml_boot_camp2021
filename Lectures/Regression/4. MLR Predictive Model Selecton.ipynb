    "# MLR Predictive Model Selection\n",

    "So now we know how to build a wide array of linear regression models. For instance if our data set contained $n$ observations of $m$ features we could build $2^m$ models without even considering interactions, polynomials, or other nonlinear transformations of the data. That's a lot of models to choose from, so in this notebook we'll introduce how you might go about selecting the best multiple linear regression model.\n",

    "## Generalization Error\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've discussed before we can't just choose the model that performs the best on our training data because we could just arbitrarily make a model that fits each training point to its target value.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may also be tempted to see which model performs best on the test set we made, but this has a similar problem. We'll just be producing models that perform really well on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to get a sense of how well our model will perform on any new random data pull, this is known as the <i>generalization error</i>.\n",
    "\n",
    "What can we do to get a sense for the generalization error of our model?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross-Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter $k$-fold cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind this technique is pretty clever. We'll introduce the technique in a way that's generalizes beyond linear regression, which will come in handy down the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "When building a predictive model, the model estimate (what we've been calling $\\hat{f}$) is found from minimizing a <i>loss function</i>. For linear regression this loss function was the MSE of the training data. Let's consider the case where we will randomly draw a new set of data (think test set) and see how well our estimate performs. Because the data was randomly drawn, the algorithm we use is a random process. So the value of the loss function (the generalization error) on this new data is an example of a random variable, let's call this random variable $G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be nice to know something about the distribution of $G$, but this is tricky with a finite amount of data. However, we can leverage a popular theorem from probability theory called the law of large numbers (see the probability theory and statistics cheat sheet).\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were able to generate a bunch of random draws of $G$, say $k$ random draws, then the law of large numbers says that:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{i=1}^k G_i \\approx E(G),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "assuming our random draws were independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in $k$-fold cross-validation we take our training set, and randomly split it into $k$ equally sized chunks. For each chunk we train the algortihm on the $k-1$ other chunks and then calculate the testing loss using the chunk we left out. Then we take the arithmetic mean of all $k$ testing errors. This is an approximation of the expected value of the true generalization error of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a picture to help illustrate the idea for $5$-fold cross-validation:\n",
    "<img src=\"CV_pic.png\" style=\"width:80%\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how this works in `sklearn` to help us choose the best model for the `Advertising` data."
