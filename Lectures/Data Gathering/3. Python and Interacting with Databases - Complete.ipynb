    "## Relational Databases and SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a brief treatment on relational databases. Relational databases are a way of storing complicated data sets in a concise but smart manner. Databases allow you to store disparate data that refer to the same objects in a related way. A common example is a marketplace. Markets have inventories of products that get sold to customers. So the market may have a csv-esque file of its product inventory and a separate file of each sale and a separate file recording each customer. These three data sets are tied together with key values that, for example, tie each sale to a specific item in the inventory table and a specific customer in the customer table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Databases are ubiquitous in industry, so knowing how to handle them is important. If you're serious you could learn how to program directly in `SQL`,  <i>the Structured Query Language</i>. This is the standard language for relational databases. `SQL` is how you can talk to a database and find the data you need. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the focus of our course is `python` we're lucky that python offers a couple of ways to interact with databases both in the base python packages with `sqlite3` (`python`'s built in SQLite driver), and with an additional package `sqlalchemy` (the `python` `SQL` toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of `SQL`). If you installed python via the anacondas distribution you should have `sqlalchemy` installed. If not you'll need to install it before we the end of the notebook. "

Check out this nice data incubator blog post <a href=\"https://blog.thedataincubator.com/2018/05/sqlite-vs-pandas-performance-benchmarks/\">https://blog.thedataincubator.com/2018/05/sqlite-vs-pandas-performance-benchmarks/</a>.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Our databases were quite small so it wasn't a big deal to turn the entire tables into dataframes. However, imagine a customer database for someone like Amazon, or a census database that contains every single census response. It would be unwise to default to storing this data as a pandas dataframe.</li>\n",
