    "In this folder we'll keep all of the notebooks associated with Data Preprocessing tasks. As we saw in our multiple linear regression material, it is not always the case that our data comes ready for modeling out of the box. Sometimes we'll need to do some preprocessing to prepare it for our algorithm/model. This holds true for almost every subset of Data Science/Machine Learning."
